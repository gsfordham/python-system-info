# python-system-info
A port of my old Bash system info script to Python. Python has a lot more cool things I wanted to try, so I started porting it over. Will be updating it over time as I make changes.

Important Info:
  1) Requires Python 3.x
  2) [More to come]
  
To Do:
  1) ~~Add colours~~ DONE!
  2) Make conditional colour formatting
  3) Split some of the longer functions
  4) [More to come]
